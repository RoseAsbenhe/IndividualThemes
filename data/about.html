                    Instead of showing you a tiny little pad lock somewhere in your
                    browser, <span class="highlight brand">SSLPersonas</span>
                    changes Firefox's entire look!
                    The theme changes with the websites you open. Each time you
                    interact with a website, its security level is checked
                    and shown to you by using a particular theme.
                </p>

                    What does 'secure' even mean?

                    <p>
                        Whenever you open a web page, you actually start a conversation
                        with a computer that's located usually very far away from you.
                        Your browser (Firefox) is able to tell whether this
                        conversation is happening without anyone being able to listen
                        (imagine the President's red phone).
                    </p>
                    <div class="short">

                    <div class="long">
                        <p>
                            It does it by exchanging secrets with the remote machine,
                            that only those two know. Those secrets are used
                            to invent a new language that only your browser and
                            the remote machine are able to speak. Now,
                            If that's the case, we call that conversation secure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If your browser is not sure, whether there is anyone listening,
                            the conversion is not secure. It then does not exchange
                            any secrets with other computers, nor does it invent any
                            languages together with them.
                            Most of the time, this is just fine.
                            But there are people out there who do want to know,
                            what conversation you're having with other computers
                            and they can quite easily listen to that.
                            That is why we say, those conversations (or connections)
                            are insecure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please note: The process is a little bit more complicated
                            that that in real life. We just try to explain it as
                            simple as we can and don't worry about the terminology.

                    If you see Firefox putting on a green theme,
                    it means that someone has gone through a lot of
                    trouble proving they are who they claim to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, that means they went to a really
                    trustworthy organization (say, something like your supreme court)
                    and revealed a lot of information about themselves.
                    That trustworthy organization issues a certificate,
                    hands it to the applicant and confirms from now
                    on that it knows them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use the green theme for web sites that have
                    gone through all that trouble. It is the
                    <span class="highlight">best theme</span> we have at the moment.

                    Seeing the blue theme is <span class="highlight">a good thing</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website that you're on when you see the blue theme
                    is secure. However, the owner of the website did not
                    walk to the trusted organization himself. Instead,
                    he sent a copy of his ID or was verified via his
                    phone. For that, the trusted organization also grants
                    certificate, but not every little detail about the
                    applicant shows up in there. But that's just fine!

                    You won't see the purple theme very often.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coming back to our conversation metaphor,
                    the purple theme only pops up if parts of the
                    conversation are not secure. This can be a bad
                    thing, because you can't know whether the insecure
                    parts are the ones you actually want to keep
                    secure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Further, it could mean that someone signed their
                    own certificate. Everyone can do that, but
                    the conversation your browser has with
                    that website can't be understood by anyone
                    else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, be <span class="highlight">somewhat cautious</span>
                    about what you do on those sites, but in general it's nice
                    to see the site is trying to establish a
                    secure conversation with you.

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, you will see the red theme quite often (you
                    might even see it right now).
                    Is it a bad thing? It depends on what you do on those
                    sites that show you the red theme. <span class="highlight">Try not to
                    type</span> anything into this website that you would not be
                    willing to shout out loud in a room full of
                    nosy neighbors. That includes for example
                    <span class="highlight">passwords, email addresses or
                         bank account numbers</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes a site that makes Firefox show you
                    the red theme first <span class="highlight">becomes a good site</span>
                    and leads you to the blue or even the green theme after
                    you click on certain of links in it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the picture above, you see that even one of the most
                    popular sites on the entire world wide web will
                    produce a red theme. But once you click on "Sign in" (of course
                    before you have entered a password), it will turn blue:
